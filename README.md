# Zmeet



Zmeet is a Web based Frontend project built majorly using React.Js Library. It's a place where users can join conferences, Ted talks and other events, both locally and across the globe. Each event also encompasses geolocation which we got using Google Maps API. There's sorting on the homepage based on  online, offline, community and personal events. Overall it's a complete UX for meetups.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
